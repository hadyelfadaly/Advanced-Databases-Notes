# Advanced Databases Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes for the **Advanced Databases** course.  
The notes are written in **Markdown** and organized by topics and parts for clarity, revision, and long-term reference.

The notes are primarily based on:
- **The Data Warehouse Toolkit** - Ralph Kimball & Margy Ross  
- **Next Generation Databases: NoSQL, NewSQL, and Big Data**  
- Course lecture slides and supplementary materials

The goal of this repository is to maintain a clean, structured, and easy-to-navigate set of notes that can be reviewed anytime during the course or later as a reference.
